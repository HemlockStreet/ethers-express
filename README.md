# Ethers x Express Boilerplate for On-Chain Automation

This is a boilerplate for quickly creating a web3-enabled api and frontend that dynamically supports whatever EVM network the backend is configured for. This `BackendFrontend` is purely for administrative use and separate from any potential consumer frontend. The server itself acts as a transaction signer (called the `fiduciary`) and executes orders on behalf of the owner.

> If you need contract automation and would prefer to do it on a locally hosted & trusted server, this is the repository for you.
